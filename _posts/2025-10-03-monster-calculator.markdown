        <span class="book-title">Monster Curiosity Calculator (MCC)</span> is a <span class="accent">database-driven</span> statistics application developed to help answer niche questions about pocket-sized monsters. It uses a <span class="accent">Python</span> script to query an existing <span class="accent">restful API</span>, gathering all needed data into an easy to parse file. That data is then processed in a <span class="accent">C++</span> application to generate a <span class="accent">SQLite database</span> that can be interacted with using a GUI developed using the <span class="accent">Dear ImGui</span> library.
