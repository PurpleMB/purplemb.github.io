    <p>
        PUNCHERMAN! was developed utilizing <span class="accent">AGILE techniques</span> across two development cycles before an eventual <span class="accent">release on Steam</span>. My work on the game as a programmer and designer ranged from developing the audio systems to <span class="accent">gathering playtest feedback</span>. However, the aspect of the game that I am most proud of is the work I did crafting thematic, <span class="accent">diegetic UI elements</span> that mesh with the world and gameplay of PUNCHERMAN!.

<span class="section-title">Introduction</span>

PUNCHERMAN! was born as a capstone project being worked on by an interdisciplinary team of 6 members, including myself. Utilizing AGILE development practices, we nurtured the game from preproduction and prototyping through playtesting and refinement until reaching our initial launch on Itch.io.     

After a period of dormancy, PUNCHERMAN! re-entered development with a new team, containing 2 returning members and 2 new members. Armed with the knowledge gained from the previous development cycle, we iterated on virtually every aspect of the game. After months of redefining the visual style, game design, and underlying code architecture we released the game for free on Steam under the name PUNCHERMAN!: FIRST DAY.

Ultimately, PUNCHERMAN! came together as a comedic, first-person game that blends elements of puzzle, simulation, and classic shooter games to create a stylish and charming experience that I am still proud to have been a part of. While it may not be perfect, I can attest to the love and learning that went into PUNCHERMAN! over the course of more than a year.

<span class="section-title">AGILE Development</span>

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, PUNCHERMAN!'s development was structured using AGILE methodology. From the onset of the project, we had a dedicated SCRUM master who ensured everyone adhered to a schedule of daily standups and regular sprint review and planning meetings. At these meetings we maintained, updated, and added to our project development board, being sure to note any tendencies in time estimation and time consumption in order to improve our timeline management as the project progressed.

Due to the environment that the initial development of PUNCHERMAN! was taking place in, it was paramount that we maintained a firm grasp on our development timeline in order to meet playtest and release deadlines (an aspect of the project I will delve into later). As such, having a framework for project organization and communication that granted us the ability to easily determine development velocity and priorities leading up to these deadlines was invaluable.

The consistency and frequency of this communication also ensured that every member of the team had a solid idea of how each facet of development was progressing. Due to the horizontal nature of the development team's structure, this unified understanding of the project's development and growth ensured that we were constantly able to source new ideas or solutions to problems from all members of the team. 

As the project advanced from early documentation and prototyping, we gained a larger and larger pool of data with which to evaluate our own capabilities. Once the time for playtesting arrived, the time spent cultivating an understanding of the production realities of our team granted us a clearer view of the ways we would be able to adjust in tandem with player feedback. 

AGILE, ultimately, provided us channels for communication and evaluation that allowed us to better define the possibility space of development. The mixture of restriction and freedom this provided allowed us to parse feedback more effectively, collaborate more seemlessly, and, most importantly, actually ship the project.

<span class="section-title">Steam Release</span>

After around a year of collective active development, it was time for PUNCHERMAN! to fly the coop of its itch.io nest. After receiving industry guidance from the talented folks over at Graffiti Games, we began navigating the process of obtaining Steam certification.

While not quite the impenetrable bastion that it once was, seeking certification from Steam did mandate that we reach a level of consistency, usability, and compatability that is less than certain after a game undergoes two distinct periods of development with two different teams. Ultimately, we leveraged the extensive amount of feedback that we had already gathered in terms of player communication, user controls, and interface presentation to craft a more unified, market-ready version of the game to submit for certification.

After a review process that went surprisingly smoothly, PUNCHERMAN! was ready to take the next step towards becoming a "real game". Despite being a small drop in the Steam bucket, releasing PUNCHERMAN! was a fantastic moment for the game and a great learning experience as we explored the asset and software requirements of being on an organized storefront. For a time after launch, PUNCHERMAN! even had an few speedrunners competing for records (and of course also competing to discover how many bugs we had missed).

PUNCHERMAN! was, when all is said and done, a learning experience.
