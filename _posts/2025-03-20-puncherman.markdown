        PUNCHERMAN! was developed utilizing AGILE techniques and went through documentation, development, and playtesting to an eventual release on Steam. My work on the game as a programmer and designer ranged from developing the audio systems in tandem with the team musician to gathering playtest feedback to determine areas where player communication was lacking. However, the aspect of the game that I am most proud of is the work I did crafting thematic, diegetic UI elements, such as the loading screens and quest UI.

<span class="section-title">Introduction</span>

PUNCHERMAN! was born as a capstone project being worked on by an interdisciplinary team of 6 members, including myself. Utilizing AGILE development practices, we nurtured the game from preproduction and prototyping through playtesting and refinement until reaching our initial launch on Itch.io.     

After a period of dormancy, PUNCHERMAN! Re-entered development with a new team, containing 2 returning members and 2 new members. Armed with the knowledge gained from the previous development cycle, we iterated on virtually every aspect of the game. After months of redefining the visual style, game design, and underlying code architecture we released the game for free on Steam under the name PUNCHERMAN!: FIRST DAY.

Having been present for both development cycles, I wound up interacting with essentially every part of the game, be it in its initial development or during the extensive reworks that occured later.
