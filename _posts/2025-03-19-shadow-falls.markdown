    <p>
        Shadow Falls was a <span class="accent">jam game</span> created over the course of two days for Texas Game Jam. During its rapid development, I deepened my understanding of ways to twist standard game development concepts to <span class="accent">create novel gameplay systems</span>. The focal point of the game was its award-winning <span class="accent">shadow puzzle system</span>, which applied everyday graphics techniques in inventive ways to faciliate unique gameplay. Beyond that, however, its failures in areas such as <span class="accent">world design</span> and player communication also provided valuable development insights.

Many of the topics discussed in this article, and more, are also addressed in a postmortem I have previously written for the game on its itch.io page. If you wish to see another deconstruction of the lessons gleamed from the development of this project, feel free to read that post <a href="https://purpleml.itch.io/shadow-falls/devlog/438456/shadow-falls-design-analysis-production-to-post-mortem" target="_blank">here</a>.
