        Hello! This is the overview box for a project!
        This will contain a TLDR for the project, its key elements,
        and what I learned working on it!

        As you can see, quite a lot of info can fit into this area!

This is a test post to see how making posts works!

So far, this seems like a very simple and efficient way to make a personal static site!
