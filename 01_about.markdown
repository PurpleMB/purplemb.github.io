I am a software developer specializing in gameplay and systems programming. I craft clean, modular code that can adapt to the ever-changing landscape of development. 

I am experienced working as part of an interdisciplinary team, and relish the opportunity to produce systems tailored to the needs of the people using them.

Each project and challenge is an opportunity to grow and deepen my understanding of programming and development through research, iteration,  and collaboration with my peers. 

Beyond programming, I love learning about anything I can find information on. Whether itâ€™s a breakdown on the hardware architecture of a retro console or a lengthy dive into the art history underlying an innocuous card game illustration, I am endlessly curious about the world and the things that people craft within it.
