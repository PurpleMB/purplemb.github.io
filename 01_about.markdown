        <p>
            Specializing in gameplay and systems programming, I craft clean, modular code driven by research, iteration, and collaboration. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I am experienced working as part of an interdisciplinary team, and constantly strive to deepen my understanding of development through the diverse knowledge of my peers. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond programming, I love learning about anything I can find information on. Whether itâ€™s a breakdown on the hardware architecture of a retro console or a lengthy dive into the art history underlying an innocuous card game illustration, I am endlessly curious about the world and the things that people craft within it.
