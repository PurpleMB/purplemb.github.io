<ul class="horizontal-list">
    <li>
    I am a software developer specializing in gameplay and systems programming. I craft clean, modular code that can adapt to the ever-changing landscape of development. 
    <br>
    I am experienced working as part of an interdisciplinary team, and relish the opportunity to produce systems tailored to the needs of the people using them.
    <br>
    Each project and challenge is an opportunity to grow and deepen my understanding of programming and development through research, iteration,  and collaboration with my peers. 
    <br>
    Beyond programming, I love learning about anything I can find information on. Whether itâ€™s a breakdown on the hardware architecture of a retro console or a lengthy dive into the art history underlying an innocuous card game illustration, I am endlessly curious about the world and the things that people craft within it.
